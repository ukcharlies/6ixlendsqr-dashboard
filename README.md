# Lendsqr Frontend Assessment

## Project Overview

A comprehensive frontend implementation of the Lendsqr admin dashboard, built with React and TypeScript. This project demonstrates modern frontend development practices with focus on maintainable architecture, thorough testing, and pixel-perfect design implementation.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **React 19.1.1**: Utilizing functional components and hooks
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development and better IDE support
- **Vite**: Modern build tool for faster development experience
- **SASS**: Modular styling with BEM methodology
- **Vitest**: For comprehensive unit and integration testing
- **React Router v6**: For declarative routing
- **MSW**: Mock Service Worker for API simulation

```

## Core Features Implementation

### Authentication Flow

- Login page with form validation
- JWT token management
- Protected route implementation
- Persistent session handling

### Dashboard Implementation

- User statistics with data visualization
- Filtered user lists with pagination
- Detailed user profile views
- Interactive data tables with sorting

### Testing Examples

```typescript
// Positive test examples
test("renders user details correctly", () => {
  expect(screen.getByText("Personal Information")).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// Negative test examples
test("handles API errors gracefully", async () => {
  mockFetch.mockRejectedValue(new Error());
  expect(screen.getByText("Error loading data")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Design Decisions & Tradeoffs

#### State Management

Chose React Context + localStorage over Redux for:

- Simpler implementation
- Smaller bundle size
- Sufficient for requirements

#### Styling Architecture

Selected SASS Modules for:

- Component scoping
- BEM compatibility
- Design system integration

#### Testing Strategy

Focused on:

- Component rendering
- User interactions
- Error scenarios
- Mobile responsiveness

### State Management Architecture

1. Local component state using useState
2. Complex state management with useReducer
3. Context API for global state
4. localStorage integration for persistence

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**

- Component rendering
- State management
- Utility functions

2. **Integration Tests**

- User flows
- API integration
- Route transitions

3. **E2E Testing**

- Critical user paths
- Form submissions
- Navigation flows
